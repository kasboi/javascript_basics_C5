# üß≠ JavaScript Curriculum Reconciliation Guide

This guide helps align and reconcile existing JavaScript teaching files with the streamlined bootcamp topic list. Use it while reviewing files with GitHub Copilot Agent or manually.

---

## ‚úÖ Objective

- Review each JavaScript teaching file.
- Match it to the appropriate topic from the bootcamp‚Äôs streamlined curriculum.
- Label it clearly and flag redundancies or opportunities for merging.
- Keep files modular and focused on one concept per file.

## üìö Streamlined JavaScript Topic List

| Topic Area              | Key Concepts Covered                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Foundations**      | Variables (`let`, `const`), data types, console   |
| **2. Control Flow**     | `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`)    |
| **3. Functions**        | Declarations, expressions, arrow functions        |
| **4. Arrays & Objects** | Creation, access, array methods (`push`, `map`)   |
| **5. DOM Manipulation** | Selecting, modifying, creating, removing elements |
| **6. Events & Forms**   | `addEventListener`, form inputs, event object     |
| **7. ES6+ Basics**      | Destructuring, template literals, default params  |
| **8. Timing & Storage** | `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `localStorage`       |
| **9. Network Basics**   | `fetch`, promises, `.then()`, `.catch()`, `JSON`  |
| **10. Best Practices**  | Readability, naming, comments, clean code         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions for Copilot Agent or Manual Review

For each JavaScript file:

1. **Label the Topic**

   - Add a comment like: `// Topic: Arrays & Objects`

2. **Check for Redundancy**

   - Is the concept already covered in another file?
   - Suggest removal or consolidation if redundant.

3. **Check for Clarity**

   - Is the code simple and beginner-friendly?
   - Suggest renaming variables or simplifying examples if needed.

4. **Keep One Concept per File**

   - Split files if they teach multiple unrelated concepts.
   - Prefer small focused examples over large projects.

5. **Optional**: Add an entry to a curriculum map (e.g. `topics-map.json` or `curriculum-index.md`)

## üß† Example Copilot Prompt (Inside a JS File)

```js
// Task: Label this file with the correct JS topic from the bootcamp guide.
// Goal: Improve clarity and reconcile curriculum overlap.
// Streamlined Topic Options:
// - Functions
// - Arrays & Objects
// - DOM Manipulation
// - Events & Forms
// - ES6+ Basics
```

---

## üîÑ Suggested File Format

```
/js-topics/
  01-variables.md          // Topic: Foundations
  02-conditionals.md       // Topic: Control Flow
  03-functions-basic.md    // Topic: Functions
  04-arrays-methods.md     // Topic: Arrays & Objects
  ...
```

## üìå Notes

- Stick to **plain, readable JavaScript** for teaching.
- Avoid early introduction of advanced features like `reduce`, async/await, or class-based OOP.
- Make use of comments and structure for self-explaining files.
- If needed, create a `README.md` inside the folder to give context for each topic.
